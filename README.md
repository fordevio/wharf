## Overview

Wharf is a full-stack web application designed to simplify Docker management on monolithic servers for teams and organizations. The platform provides a centralized interface for managing Docker resources through a web browser, eliminating the need for direct command-line Docker operations.

### Core Capabilities:

* `Container Management`: Start, stop, pause, create,update, delete, and monitor Docker containers
* `Image Management`: List, tag, delete, and prune Docker images
* `Volume Management`: Create, delete, list, and prune Docker volumes
* `Network Management`: Create, delete, and manage Docker networks and container connections
* `User Management`: Role-based access control (RBAC) with Read, Write, and Execute permissions
* `Monitoring`: Real-time container statistics and log viewing
* `Web Interface`: Complete React-based single-page application

### Security and Authentication

Wharf implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control. Users have three permission levels:

* `Read`: View containers, images, volumes, networks
* `Write`: Start, stop, pause, create resources
* `Execute`: Delete, prune, remove resources
